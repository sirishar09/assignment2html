            He is an only child and is apparently from an affluent family.[citation needed] Chandler's parents announced their divorce 
            to him over Thanksgiving dinner when he was nine years old, an event which causes him to refuse to celebrate the holiday in 
            his adulthood and develop his notorious sense of humour as a defense mechanism. 
            It is revealed in season 1 that he went to an all-boys high school.
